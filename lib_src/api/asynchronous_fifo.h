 * samples across from producer to consumer through an elastic queue, and run
 * a PID algorithm to calculate the best way to equalise the input clock relative
 * to the output clock. Therefore, the timestamps
 * have to be measured on either the same clock or two very similar clocks.
 * It is probably fine to use the reference clocks on two tiles, provided
 * the tiles came out of reset at more or less the same time. Using the
 * clocks from two different chips would require the two chips to share an
 * oscillator, and for them to come out of reset simultaneously.

 * @param   state               ASRC structure to push the sample into

 * @param   samples             The sample values.

 * @param   n                   The number of samples
 *
 * @param   timestamp           The number of ticks when this sample was input.
 *
 * @returns The current estimate of the mismatch of input and output frequencies.
 *          This is represented as a 32-bit signed number. Zero means no mismatch,
 *          a value less than zero means that the producer is faster than the consumer,
 *          a value greater than zero means that the producer is slower than the consumer.
 *          The value should be scaled by 2**-32. That is, the current best
 *          approximation for consumer_speed/producer_speed is 1 + (return_value * 2**-32)
 *
 *          The output is filtered and should be applied directly as a correction factor
 *          eg, multiplied into an ASRC ratio, or multiplied into a PLL timing.
