/**
 * Function that interpolates a timestamp for a sample generated by the ASRC.
 * Given a measured timestamp for the sample going into the ASRC, the asrc control
 * structure, and the expected output frequency, this function returns a timestamp
 * for when the last sample was produced by the ASRC.
 *
 * @param  timestamp       Value of the reference clock taken when the last sample
 *                         fed into the ASRC was sampled.
 *
 * @param  asrc_ctrl       ASRC control block
 *
 * @param  ideal_freq      Expected base frequency to which the ASRC is operating;
 *                         eg, 48000 or 44100
 *                         TBD - WHAT IS THIS NUMBER?
